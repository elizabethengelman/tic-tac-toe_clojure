This is a Tic Tac Toe game, written in Clojure using Speclj as a testing framework. The first implementation will allow for human-vs-human play. The next extension will allow for a human to play against the computer. The user will be able to choose whether they play against a dumb computer which chooses random moves, or a smart computer that uses the minimax algorithm to choose its moves.

To run this program, clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/elizabethengelman/tic-tac-toe_clojure.git
```

Then, in the terminal, cd into the project directory and type in lein run:

```
cd tic-tac-toe_clojure
lein run
```

To run the tests, once you're in the project directory type in lein spec:

```
lein spec
```
